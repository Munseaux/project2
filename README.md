# project2

A website that maps earthquakes over the past 30 days, and then all the images shake harder and harder based on the magnitude of the earthquake you click on. 8/9 makes the screen shake so hard you can't read anything at all. 

This webpage will be made with bootstrap, javascript, and leaflet. It will display earthquake information, and will also scrape the web for news stories about the specific earthquakes that are selected, providing links to further reading. 

Data viz element?? 

Use plotly to make a graph of all of the various earthquakes (TBD what specific parts of the earthquakes should be graphed against one another) , and then highlight the selected earthquake on the table.
