# project2

A website that maps earthquakes over the past 30 days, and then all the images shake harder and harder based on the magnitude of the earthquake you click on. 8/9 makes the screen shake so hard you can't read anything at all. 

Use flask and Mongo to grab the geojason data from the USGS. Serve data to javascript with flask, make visualizations with d3/leaflet/plotly/whatever we end up using. 


This webpage will be made with bootstrap, javascript, and D3. It will display earthquake information, and will also scrape the web for news stories about the specific earthquakes that are selected, providing links to further reading. TBD javascript library that we did not cover in class. 

Data viz element?? 

Use plotly to make a graph of all of the various earthquakes (TBD what specific parts of the earthquakes should be graphed against one another) , and then highlight the selected earthquake on the table. use tooltip to display graph, have web scrape of news stories next to graph.
