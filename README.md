What about a stock data microsite that takes in sectors of the market and provides an algorithim for trading those sectors. 

What about a site that identifies stocks poised for breakouts based on bollinger bands and moving average crossovers. Stocks initially selected by large recent downturns. 

What about a website that finds the cheapest food prices in the country and reccomends thrifty places to have dinner. I'd want to do it so it suggests across the entire continental US and then sends you a link with directions from your current location. Could probably just do a really basic google maps link generator thing. Would be easy. I'd like to use user input for the location services -- it would be a pain in the ass to try and extract location from the browser.
